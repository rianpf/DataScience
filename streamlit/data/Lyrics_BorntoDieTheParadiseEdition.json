    "lyrics": "Lolita Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWould you be mine?\nWould you be my baby tonight?\nCould be kissing my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine\n'Cause I like you quite a lot, everything you got\nDon't you know?\nIt's you that I adore\nThough I make the boys fall like dominoes\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nKiss me in the D-A-R-K, dark tonight\n(D-A-R-K, do it my way)\nKiss me in the P-A-R-K, park tonight\n(P-A-R-K, let them all say)\n\n[Chorus]\nHey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!\nI know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play\nHey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!\nWhistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay\nNo more skippin' rope, skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown\nJust you and me feelin' the heat even when the sun goes down\n\n[Verse 2]\nI could be yours, I could be your baby tonight\nTopple you down from your sky forty stories high\nShining like a God, can't believe I caught you and so\nLook at what I bought, not a second thought, oh, Romeo\n[Pre-Chorus]\nKiss me in the D-A-R-K, dark tonight\n(D-A-R-K, do it my way)\nKiss me in the P-A-R-K, park tonight\n(P-A-R-K, let them all say)\n\n[Chorus]\nHey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!\nI know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play\nHey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!\nWhistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay\nNo more skippin' rope, skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown\nJust you and me feelin' the heat even when the sun goes down\n\n[Bridge]\nI want my cake and I wanna eat it too\nI want to have fun and be in love with you\nI know that I'm a mess with my long hair\nAnd my suntan, short dress, bare feet, I don't care\nWhat they say about me, what they say about me\nBecause I know that it's L-O-V-E\nYou make me happy, you make me happy\nAnd I never listen to anyone\n(Let them all say!)\n\n[Chorus]\nHey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!\nI know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play\nHey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!\nWhistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay\nNo more skippin' rope, skippin' heartbeats with the boys downtown\nJust you and me feelin' the heat even when the sun goes down62Embed"
